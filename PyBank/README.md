# PyBank Python Challenge

 We are given a financial dataset called "budget_data.csv". The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". We are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company.

## Challenge Details

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records in "budget_data.csv" to calculate each of the following values:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset.

  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.

  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
 
  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* Data for the above analysis is present in the Resources folder in "budget_data.csv" file.

* Analysis should align with the results shown on the Module challenge page on canvas.

* Final python script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file "output.txt" with the results to the analysis folder.

## Assumptions made while coding

  **1:** First row is header.

  ## How to execute code?

### Prerequisites  
 * Need to have python3 installed.
 * The path to run the file on terminal should align with the folder path where the csv file is saved on machine.

### Steps to run

  * From Terminal run "python PyBank/main.py"

## Results 
 * Once the python scripts runs successfully financial results can be seen on the terminal. 

 * Total months, Average change in profit and loss, Greatest increase in profits and Greatest decrease in profits results for all these calulations are printed on the terminal.

 * Above results are also saved in "output.txt" file at run time under analysis folder.

 * Snapshots of the results can be found in Images folder.
