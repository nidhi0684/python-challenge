# PyPoll Python Challenge

 In this Challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. We are given a set of poll data called "election_data.csv". The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". We are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the casted votes.

## Challenge Details

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records in "election_data.csv" to calculate each of the following values:

  - The total number of votes cast.

  - A complete list of candidates who received votes.

  - The percentage of votes each candidate won.

  - The total number of votes each candidate won.
 
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Data for the above analysis is present in the Resources folder in "election_data.csv" file.

* Analysis should align with the results shown on the Module challenge page on canvas.

* Final python script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file "output.txt" with the results to the analysis    folder.

## Assumptions made while coding

  **1:** First row is header.

  ## How to execute code?

### Prerequisites  
 * Need to have python3 installed.
 * The path to run the file on terminal should align with the folder path where the csv file is saved on machine.

### Steps to run

  * From Terminal run "python PyPoll/main.py"

## Results 
 * Once the python scripts runs successfully election poll results can be seen on the terminal. 

 * Total Votes, List of candidates who received votes, Percentage of votes each candidate won, Total number of votes each candidate won, The winner of the election based on popular vote all these results are printed on the terminal.

 * Above results are also saved in "output.txt" file at run time under analysis folder.

 * Snapshots of the results can be found in Images folder.
